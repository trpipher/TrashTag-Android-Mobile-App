# TrashTag Mobile Android App
TrashTag is a mobile application that lets users place pins on a live map identifying trash to be picked up. 
A user can also travel to a trash pickup pin on the map and pick up the trash themselves and receive points. 
TrashTag also includes a global leaderboard displaying the top 10 users with the highest amount of points!

Today, trash is everywhere. It's in our oceans, streets, and communities. With plastic being the one of the largest culprits of dangerous wastes, we wanted to build an application to help prevent littering while also incentivizing others to pick up litter.
