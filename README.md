# TrashTag Mobile Android App
TrashTag is a mobile application that lets users place pins on a live map identifying trash to be picked up. 
A user can also travel to a trash pickup pin on the map and pick up the trash themselves and receive points. 
TrashTag also includes a global leaderboard displaying the top 10 users with the highest amount of points!
